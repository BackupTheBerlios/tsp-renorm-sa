The heart of our method for solving the TSP problem is the renormalization theory. The renormalization theory is originating from theoretical physics. In theoretical physics renormalization is used to study the observe the changes in a physical system. The changes are observed by looking to the problem at different scales. This idea is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:scales}.
\newline\newline\noindent
This idea is mapped onto the Traveling Salesman problem. The total square in figure \ref{fig:scales} can be seen as the total area where the cities are located. When estimating the shortest route, we start at a large scale, and we keep zooming in until our estimated path visiting all cities is known. The procedure is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:renormalization}. The image on the topleft of the figure is the basic block. This basic block consists of four cells. A cell represents a virtual city, available if one or more cities are within the cell. The general idea of the algorithm is to solve the Traveling Salesman problem for the larger block. This can be done easily, because a Traveling Salesman problem for at most four cities can be easily solved, by simply enumerating all possibilities. Then this block can be divided into four subblocks. Together with some information acquired from the larger block, the Traveling Salesman problem can again be solved for the four subblocks. This process is repeated until there is at most one city in a cell, and the estimated route is known. In the following subsection we will describes the steps in the algorithm in more detail.
\subsection{Preprocessing step}

The preprocessing step prevents the performance penalty each time you need to calculate an optimal route in a block. Basically this means that for every possible configuration you calculate the optimal path. There are two aspects which can be altered, the border point at which the route is started and the visited cells.
\newline\newline\noindent
For retrieving the shortest route through a block, it is considered as a graph. The nodes are the border points and the cell points (Lying in the centrum of a cell). The nodes are connected by multiple
Before treating on the algorithm the preprocessing is considered.  The preprocessing consists of calculating all shortest paths in the basic blocks. Here all possible subsets of cells that needs to be visited are considered.
\newline\newline\noindent
The basic block can be treated as a graph, the border points and the cell points are the nodes. There are edges between the border points and their closest cell point(s). The cell points are also connected with an edge with the other cell points. This set-up can be seen in the topleft picture of figure \ref{fig:renormalization}. For getting the shortest route, a breadth first search is used. Here all possible paths, without cycles, between the starting and end node are calculated. Using these set of paths, the shortest routes visiting subsets of cell points are searched.

For finding the shortest route we do not treat all cities independently, but we first try to solve the problem at the largest scale. For doing this we divide the square into a block of a two by two cells. Within these cells we take the average behavior. In case of the Traveling Salesman problem, we look if there is a city within the cell or not. Now we decide the shortest route for this two by two cell which visits all the cells where a city is located.
\newline\newline\noindent
This basic two by two cell can be seen in figure \ref{fig:basic_cell}. We still need to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem on this smaller block. This block however, is small enough to compute the shortest path with reasonable performance. The renormalization method, needs to solve the TSP on this basic cells repeatedly. For that reason all possible shortest paths are precalculated. This means that from every possible route through the basic block, the shortest path is calculated. This shortest path is calculated for every possible combination of cells which needs to be visited.
\newline\newline\noindent
When we solved the problem at a specific scale, we zoom in further. This means that the blocks used in the current scale are divide in four subblocks, each consist four cells. The route which we calculated in the previous block, can now be used for calculating the shortest path through each of these subblocks. For this we determine the cross points of the used edges in the shortest route




Renormalization Theory is a deterministic approach to solving the TSP problem. The renormalization theory is originating from theoretical physics. In theoretical physics renormalization theory is used for investigating the changes of a physical system, by viewing it at different scales.
\newline\newline\noindent
When we are applying renormalization theory to the TSP problem, we first solve the TSP at a large scale. This solution is used recursively to solve it a smaller scale. This is repeated until the scale is small enough for retrieving a hamiltonian path connecting all cities.
\newline\newline\noindent
Now we summerarized the method, we go more into detail. The solving process is started by calculating the shortest path for a two by two block...
