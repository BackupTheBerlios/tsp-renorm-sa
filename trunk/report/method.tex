\section{Renormalization Theory}
Renormalization Theory is a deterministic approach to solving the TSP problem. The renormalization theory is originating from theoretical physics. In theoretical physics renormalization theory is used for investigating the changes of a physical system, by viewing it at different scales.
\newline\newline\noindent
When we are applying renormalization theory to the TSP problem, we first solve the TSP at a large scale. This solution is used recursively to solve it a smaller scale. This is repeated until the scale is small enough for retrieving a hamiltonian path connecting all cities.
\newline\newline\noindent
Now we summerarized the method, we go more into detail. The solving process is started by calculating the shortest path for a two by two block...
