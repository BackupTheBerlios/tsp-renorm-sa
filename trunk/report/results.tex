\section{Results}
To demonstrate the potency of our approach we have solved the TSP problem for
multiple data sets. We compare the optimal results to the results found using
the combination of renormalization and TSA. To analyze the quality of the
proposed technique the state of the system while seeking the solution for two
different data sets is compared.

\subsection{TSA configuration}
To find the optimal results the TSA system has to be configured. The
motivation to choose for a TSA process instead of a SA, is that TSA
necessitates less fine tuning than SA. Furthermore, renormalization is 
appreciated for the possibility to be applicable without any specific
configuration. For these reasons we considered it inappropriate to seek
parameters which resulted in the most optimal solution.

This was possible for all parameters but for the begin temperature. By more
closely observing equation \eqref{eq:accept} it is clear that whenever the
energy is much larger than the temperature the exponent becomes very small.
Especially for very large problems this can lead to underflows. Therefore the
begin temperature was roughly adjusted considering the number of cities in a
problem. No research has been conducted on the effects of the begin
temperature on the behaviour of the TSA. Again, because no specific fine
tuning is considered.

The remaining parameters are chosen such that they reflect a specific TSA
system. A large temperature adjustment factor ($\beta$, see section
\ref{sec:temp}) allows the system to take longer to stabilize. The end
temperature is set to prevent slow converging which are unable to optimize the
path more. The perturbation sensitivity ($\alpha$, see section \ref{sec:per}) is set to
react marginally to the Brownian motion. A summary of the values is given in
table \ref{tab:param}.

\subsection{Overall Results}
The TSA process allows to improve the normalization. This is demonstrated by
computing the shortest route for different problem sets. The problems used vary in
the number of cities. To find an optimal result the only parameter which was
changed is the beginning temperature of the TSA process.

Compared to the worst results found by using renormalization TSA is on average
21.22\% more accurate when approximating the shortest route. This value is
based on nine problem sets of respectively, 127, 130, 198, 200, 445, 575, 657,
1002 and 1060 cities. The standard deviation of the mean is $0.04$. 

In Fig. \ref{fig:results}~an overview is given of the results found. The
dark dots represent the optimal solution found at the end of the TSA process.
The circles designate the solution found if TSA would not be used. The
triangles denote the worst solution found during the TSA process. It is clear
from the picture that seeking an optimal rotation angle leads to better
approximations of the shortest route. Yet, as we shall see in the next section
TSA also partly undoes the computational benefit obtained by using renormalization.

To show the effect the number of cities has on the accuracy of the approximation a
model is built. The model is 
\[ 
	shortest~route = \gamma \cdot cities 
\]
By fitting this model on the data using a least square estimation technique
$\gamma$ is approximated to be 0.000180. The p-value of the model is
0.0001795. Based on this it can be concluded that although the proposed
approach less accurate as the number of cities increases, the deterioration is
only 0.0180 \% per city.

TSA allows to find a shorter route for all the problem sets. However the
approximation becomes less accurate as the number of cities increase.

\subsection{Two data sets compared}
To show that the TSA process increases the computing time considerably we
analyze the dynamics of the system while solving two data sets. The first data
set contains 198 cities which are concentrated in a few clusters, see Fig.
\ref{fig:d198}. In contrast, the second data set which contains 575 cities is
much more uniformly distributed, see Fig. \ref{fig:rat575}.

The dynamics of the TSA process while solving both problems are showed in Fig.
\ref{fig:res198}~for 198 cities and in Fig. \ref{fig:res575}~for 575 cities.
In both cases the convergence of the temperature to the end temperature takes
very long. While in the case of 198 cities the reduction of the temperature
also leads to a lower energy, this is not case for 575 cities. Analogue to the
annealing process in metallurgy, it is possible that the temperature
diminishes and that the system maintains a high energy, resulting in a
non-optimal system. This is clearly the case when solving the second problem set.

The delayed reduction of the change of the rotation angle when the temperature
of the system diminishes is attributed to the value of the initial
temperature. In the case of 198 cities the initial temperature is set to 1000.
For 575 cities the temperature is set to 5000. For the first problem this
barrier is crossed at time 100, for the second this is around time 5600.  It
is clear that after these times rotation angle change reduces.

The reason why TSA is used is to seek for several optima and then to select
the global optimum found and then fine tune the rotation angle to improve the
optimum. Yet the auto-adjusting cooling schedule does not always lead to this
behaviour. For the first data set, the rotation angle at which the shortest
route is found is 0.9258 $\pi$ radian, the rotation angle found at the lowest
temperature is identical. However for the 575 cities problem system is cool at
a rotation angle of 0.0112 $\pi$ radian. Which is not close to the optimal rotation
angle of 2.3126 $\pi$ radian. This latter observation supports our claim that the
second system is not in an optimal state.

In the case of 575 cities the shortest route is quickly found. This is
attributed to the perturbation function. Because of the large scale of the
graphs in Fig. \ref{fig:rat575} it is not immediately clear that at the
beginning the perturbation function allows to visit many different states.
Thereby enabling the system to find a shortest route. For the 198 cities
problem it takes longer to find the optimum. Only once the system is much
cooler the solution is found by fine-tuning the rotation angle.

Although the TSA permits to find a optimal solution the computational costs
are considerably increased. Considering the 575 cities problem more than 13000
iterations are necessary to cool the system to an appropriate temperature. For
the 198 cities problem 2500 iterations are necessary. Other problem sets
we considered needed 13000 iterations for 1002 cities and 1100 iterations for
200 cities.

\subsection{Conclusion}
Improving the classical renormalization algorithm using a TSA process improves
the accuracy of the result. However the computational costs increase considerably.
Most of the time is consumed towards the end of the convergence of the
temperature. This could be reduced by using another cooling schedule then the 
auto-adjusting schedule used by the TSA.
