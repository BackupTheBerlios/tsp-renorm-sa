\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we have presented a method for solving the euclidean TSP. For solving the TSP we have combined Thermodynamic Simulated Annealing and Renormalization Theory. The results showed that the Renormalization Theory is a not very precise way of solving the TSP. Despite extensive search for the best rotation of the grid used in the Renormalization procedure, we got a mean accuracy of XX procent.

We can conclude that the rotation of the grid has an effect of the accuracy of the solution, but the effort of finding this correct rotation is too large. The Renormalization procedure is perfectly suited for a fast approximation of a TSP problem. This TSP problem however must fit to certain properties. TSP problems which have a large number of cities, or have clusters of cities lying close to eachother are not suited for TSP.
